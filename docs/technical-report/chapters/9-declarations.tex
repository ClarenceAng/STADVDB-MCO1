\subsection{Declaration of Generative AI in Scientific Writing}

During the preparation of this work, the authors used GitHub Copilot and Claude AI to assist with the following tasks: code completion and syntax suggestions during SQL script development, debugging MySQL configuration issues, generating boilerplate code for the Next.js OLAP application, and structuring sections of the technical report. After using these tools, the authors reviewed and edited the content as needed and take full responsibility for the content of this publication.
